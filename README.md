# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
## This project helps in  Visualization of various Sorting  Algorithms in Python.
In this repository I had simulated  various Sorting Algorithms  in Python using  VS Code Editor for better understanding and Analysis in a graphical manner and observe how these Alogithms work for different size of datasets. 
All plots are genereated using Matplotlib library in Python.
## Following  Algorithms are used in simulation :-
### 1.Insertion Sort                                                                                                                                                            
### 2.Selection Sort                           
### 3.Quick Sort
### 4.Merge Sort
### 5.Bubble Sort
### 6.Heap Sort
