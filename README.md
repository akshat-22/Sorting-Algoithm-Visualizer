# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
## This project helps visualization of various Sorting  Algorithms in python.
In this repository I had simulated  various Sorting Algorithms  in python using  VS Code Editor for better understanding and Analysis in a graphical manner and observe how these Alogithms work for different size of datasets. 

## Sorting Algorithm Visualized are:-
### 1.Insertion Sort                                                                                                                                                                ### 2.Selection Sort                           
### 3.Quick Sort
### 4.Merge Sort
### 5.Bubble Sort
### 6.Heap Sort
