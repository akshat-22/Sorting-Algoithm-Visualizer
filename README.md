# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
## This Project helps in  Visualization of Different Sorting  Algorithms in Python.
In this repository I had simulated  various Sorting Algorithms  in Python using  VS Code Editor for better understanding and  Performance Analysis for different size of datasets. 
All plots are generated using Matplotlib library in Python.
## Following  Algorithms are used in simulation :-
### 1.Insertion Sort                                                                                                                                                            
### 2.Selection Sort                           
### 3.Quick Sort
### 4.Merge Sort
### 5.Bubble Sort
### 6.Heap Sort

# How to Use
## Install 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
python main.py function_name

Pass function name as a command line argument from list of functions above (in all lower case and spaces replaced by underscore).

## for example :
python main.py quick_sort
